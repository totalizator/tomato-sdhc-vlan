= Multiple SSIDs =

Notes on experimental/initial support of multiple SSIDs (guest wireless, no GUI support at this moment).

= WARNING =

This whole thing is HIGHLY experimental and most likely, quite buggy. These instructions have only been tested on a WRT54GL v1.1, so proceed at your own risk. 

== STEP 0 ==

Log in via telnet/SSH on your router and run "nvram get wl0_corerev". If you get anything smaller than the number 9 (nine) for nvram variable "wl0_corerev", please stop now (do not proceed any further).

== STEP 1 ==

Backup your router configuration, then install/flash a multiSSID-enabled firmware image suitable for your router and wait for your router to reboot.

== STEP 2 ==

Go to Basic/Network (basic-network.asp) and create/set up a new LAN bridge. Before considering this part 'done' and proceeding to the next step, make sure you have (at least) two LAN bridges configured (i.e. br0 and br1), each of them on its own IP/subnet (you probably want to enable DHCP on them, so double-check the whole thing before moving on). Also, make sure the 'standard' wireless interface is properly configured and enabled. Once you're done, hit 'save' at the bottom of the page and wait for a few moments as a few services/subsystems might need to be restarted on your router (i.e. network/firewall and/or other services).

== STEP 3 ==

Now go to Advanced/VLAN (advanced-vlan.asp), create a new VLAN and assign/link it to that new LAN bridge you just created on the last step. While not absolutely required, it might be a good idea to (re)assign at least one physical ethernet port on your router to this new VLAN (for troubleshooting purposes). Once you're done configuring VLANs, ports and LAN bridge assignments, hit 'save' at the bottom of the page and wait for your router to reboot (it's strongly recommended to just leave alone that 'Wireless' section on this page for now).

== STEP 4 ==

Once your device finishes rebooting and is back online, head on again to the same admin/pages mentioned above (Basic/Network and Advanced/VLAN) to triple-check your settings. At this point, you might want to test if DHCP is indeed working as it should on each of your LAN bridges/VLANs (as well as your wired/ethernet ports assignments).

== STEP 5 ==

Since we don't have a GUI just yet, open a telnet/SSH session to your router and get ready to configure your guest WLAN :-)

== WLAN Settings ==

Consider the following example/scenario:

[http://tomato-sdhc-vlan.googlecode.com/files/multissid_example_1_basic_network.png]

There are 2 LAN bridges configured (br0 and br1). DHCP is enabled on both.

[http://tomato-sdhc-vlan.googlecode.com/files/multissid_example_2_advanced_vlan.png]

Ports 1, 2 and 3 are assigned to VLAN 1 (bridged to the primary LAN/br0). Port 4 is assigned to VLAN 3 (bridged to LAN1/br1). The WAN port is part of VLAN 2 (which is our WAN, anyways).

So, to create a guest wireless network without any encryption (open) and SSID 'guest', we'd use the following commands:

{{{
nvram set wl0_vifs='wl0.1'           # wl0/virtual interfaces
nvram set wl0.1_ifname='wl0.1'       # wl0.1 interface name
nvram set wl0.1_bss_enabled='1'      # this BSSID should be enabled
nvram set wl0.1_ssid='guest'         # the SSID of this network
nvram set wl0.1_closed='0'           # broadcast SSID
nvram set wl0.1_mode='ap'            # access point mode
nvram set lan1_ifnames='vlan3 wl0.1' # interfaces bridged to LAN1/br1
}}}

Then, we need to restart the network subsystem on the router:
{{{
service net restart
}}}

And after a few moments... you'll have your 'guest' wireless network up and running:

== Example settings for WEP ==
{{{
nvram set wl0_vifs='wl0.1'
nvram set wl0.1_bss_enabled='1'
nvram set wl0.1_security_mode='wep'
nvram set wl0.1_wep='enabled'
nvram set wl0.1_wep_bit='128'
nvram set wl0.1_ifname='w0.1'
nvram set wl0.1_ssid='guest'
nvram set wl0.1_closed='0'
nvram set wl0.1_key1='9FDF3BFDFB10AFEB0925EF9605'
nvram set wl0.1_key2='79966B0F8AF9ADB2F03DCCF0FC'
nvram set wl0.1_key3='D6272A95700B2BB90F1FFC1BF4'
nvram set wl0.1_key4='00E754864AA708294298A57DE0'
nvram set wl0.1_key='1'
nvram set wl0.1_passphrase='test'
nvram set wl0.1_mode='ap'
nvram set lan1_ifnames='vlan3 wl0.1'
service net restart
}}}

== Example settings for WPA2 Personal ==

{{{
nvram set wl0_vifs='wl0.1'
nvram set wl0.1_ssid='guest'
nvram set wl0.1_wpa_psk='supersecret'
nvram set wl0.1_bss_enabled='1'
nvram set wl0.1_mode='ap'
nvram set wl0.1_ifname='wl0.1'
nvram set wl0.1_security_mode='wpa2_personal'
nvram set wl0.1_crypto='tkip+aes'
nvram set wl0.1_wpa_gtk_rekey='3600'
nvram set wl0.1_akm='psk2'
nvram set wl0.1_auth_mode='none'
nvram set wl0.1_closed='0'
nvram set lan1_ifnames='vlan3 wl0.1'
service net restart
}}}

NOTE: if you want to configure/use any kind of WPA security in more than one wireless interface (WPA/WPA2, Personal/Enterprise and any/all variants/combinations), you should set the following nvram variable before running "service net restart":

{{{
nvram set nas_alternate='1'
}}}

When this nvram variable is set, an alternative method will be used to start as many instances of the "nas" service as needed (nas is the proprietary binary tool that sets up dynamic encryption on the wireless device).

Once you're done changing settings, you should save/commit nvram (so they will be 'remembered' by the router across reboots/restarts):
{{{
nvram commit
}}}
